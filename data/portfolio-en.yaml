  detailed: |
    I am a Senior Software Engineer and Product Engineer with 15 years of experience building bridges between complex business challenges and high-impact technology solutions. My mission is simple: to use technology to solve real-world problems.

    My career has taken me from backend development roles to leadership positions such as Technical Lead and CTO. This journey taught me that the best technology serves a clear purpose, leading me to embrace a 'Product Engineer' mindset: I prioritize deeply understanding the business 'why' before engineering the technical 'how'.

    Today, my passion is centered on Artificial Intelligence—not just as a technology, but as a strategic accelerator. I leverage AI to automate complexity, freeing up human potential to focus on creativity and strategy, thereby enhancing team autonomy and productivity.
